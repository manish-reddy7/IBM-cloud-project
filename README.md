# 🚰 Improved Source of Drinking Water – Capstone Project

This project analyzes and predicts household access to improved sources of drinking water in India using data from the **78th Round of the Multiple Indicator Survey (MIS)**. The system is built and deployed using **IBM Cloud Lite services** including **Watson Studio** and **AutoAI**.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Many people in India, especially in rural and underdeveloped areas, still lack access to clean and safe drinking water. Despite government efforts aligned with the **Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 6)**, there are large disparities in water access across regions and communities. This project aims to study survey data to identify patterns and predict whether a household has access to improved drinking water.

## 💡 Project Objective

- Analyze household-level data to understand water access patterns
- Build a predictive model using IBM Watson AutoAI
- Visualize results to support data-driven policy decisions
- Deploy and demonstrate the system on IBM Cloud Lite

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **IBM Watson Studio** (AutoAI, Jupyter Notebooks)
- **IBM Cloud Object Storage**
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**
- **AutoAI for automated ML pipeline**
- **Streamlit or Flask** (for optional dashboard)
- **ChatGPT** for content structuring and research guidance
